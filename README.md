# Dotnet/Azure CLI in a DevContainer

A base devcontainer that I am finding useful for building out Azure Functions. The development experience on Windows seems aewful for Azure Functions. The devcontainer approach seems much better. I run this on WSL.

Instead of documenting everything (and it getting out of date) please feel free to open in a devcontainer and take a look around, or set-up a deployment pipeline in Azure Dev Ops.

If you are working with [Bicep or .NET](https://github.com/jsacapdev/dotnet.bicep) I have another repository that may also be of help.

This repository is a bit of a work in progress as I am currently working on a project that is helping me build it out. But if (more likely when) you encounter issues, please raise an issue and I will try and help.
